### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm Jonathon, a Full-Stack Web Developer!

Recently, I have been contributing to a non-profit project as a Technical Project Manager, working to develop enhancements for an existing codebase that facilitates technical code education opportunities by matching development mentors to mentees.
 
 
 Some of the Languages that I have gained experience with are HTML, CSS, JavaScripts, React.js, Node.js, and Express!
 
 Check out some of my Projects!
